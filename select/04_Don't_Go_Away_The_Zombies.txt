Day comes, sun comes
Climbs the other side of the hill
Day light and the new light
Comes climbing up the hill

DonÂ't go away
DonÂ't take your love with the night
DonÂ't go away
With the night, please stay

Through the night I can feel you love me
I know I believe it
I want to hold you tight
While the warmth of the night surrounds us
I want night to last forever
I know youÂ'll go
Of the first light
Of the day comes into sight
YouÂ'll go from me

Through the night youÂ'll temper my feeling
Hold me to you
I know you love me real
But the day I canÂ't feel so sure

I want the night to last forever
I know youÂ'll go

From the first light of the day
Comes into sight
YouÂ'll go from me

Day comes, sun comes
Climbs the other side of the hill
Day light and the new light
Comes climbing up the hill

DonÂ't go away
DonÂ't take your love with the night
DonÂ't go away
With the night, please stay

DonÂ't go away
DonÂ't go away
DonÂ't go away
DonÂ't go away
