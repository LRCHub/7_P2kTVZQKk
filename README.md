```
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh, Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh, Honey
when you knock on my door
Uh I gave you my key
Uh uh
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Uh uh
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh oh
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
And nobody told us
Cause nobody showed us
Now it's up to us babe
Ooh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, You put the
sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
Uh uh
Nobody knows it
But, when I was down
I was your clown
Uh uh
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh oh
I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Oh oh
I give you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my,
Don't go breaking my,
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my,
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart
Oh oh, Yeah
